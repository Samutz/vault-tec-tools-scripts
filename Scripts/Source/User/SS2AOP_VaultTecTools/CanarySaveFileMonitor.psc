; Inside the quotes, type the full script name including the folder you created. So if you put this in Fallout 4\Data\Scripts\Source\User\MyMod\ and you kept the script name the same, your full script name would be MyMod:CanarySaveFileMonitor (this should be the same thing you put in the Scriptname line at the top of this script!)
